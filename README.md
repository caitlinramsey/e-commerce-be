## Installation
You will install node.js using the command line. [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) will need to be downloaded on your local computer. You will also need to download the necessary node_modules using "npm install" prior to setting up the database. Additionally, you will need a way to perform CRUD operations on the database, such as using the application Insomnia.

## Usage
Start the database by logging into [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and using command "source db/schema.sql";. After this,seed the table with your categories/products/tags using the phrase "npm run seed". You will be able to update your e-commerce database using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download).
